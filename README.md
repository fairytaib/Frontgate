## Design and User Experience
The design emphasizes a futuristic, technical aesthetic to resonate with the web development theme. Semantic HTML and a simple color scheme ensure clarity and focus, while a modern, futuristic font reinforces the theme. The overall layout and structure support easy navigation and a smooth user journey.

### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](./readme_pictures/color-scheme/color-scheme.png)

The design of the website incorporates the following color scheme to ensure a modern, visually appealing, and user-focused experience:

#### Colors Used

1. **Gunmetal (#1F2933)**: Used for the navbar and some background sections to provide a sleek, dark tone that conveys professionalism and modernity.
2. **Charcoal (#2C3E50)**: Utilized in main content sections to create a clear, unobtrusive background that allows text and visuals to stand out.
3. **Payne's Gray (#505B68)**: Employed as an accent background to create variation between sections while maintaining cohesion in the overall design.
4. **Rich Black (#0D1B2A)**: Applied in the footer to provide a strong, grounding element at the bottom of the page.
5. **Giants Orange (#FF5722)**: Exclusively used for Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons to draw attention and encourage user interaction.

This color scheme creates a balance between usability, aesthetics, and purpose, helping to engage users while guiding their attention toward key interactive elements like the CTA buttons.

### Typography

The typography of the website was chosen to enhance readability while maintaining a modern and futuristic design aesthetic. Two complementary fonts from Google Fonts were used:

#### Fonts
1. **Orbitron**:

  ![Orbitron Font](./readme_pictures/typographie/orbitron.png)
   - Used for headings and titles across the website.
   - A futuristic, geometric font that aligns with the technical and modern theme of the site.
   - Creates a strong visual impact, drawing attention to important sections and maintaining a sleek aesthetic.
   

2. **Roboto**:

  ![Orbitron Font](./readme_pictures/typographie/roboto.png)
   - Used for body text and paragraph content.
   - A clean, sans-serif font that ensures high readability, even for long sections of text.
   - Complements Orbitron by providing a balance between modernity and legibility.

#### Font Usage
- **Headings**: Orbitron is used for all heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.), giving the site a consistent and bold structure.
- **Body Text**: Roboto is used for paragraphs, navigation links, and other textual content to ensure readability across devices.
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Both fonts are utilized strategically to make buttons and links stand out while staying consistent with the overall theme.

### Rationale
The combination of these fonts creates a futuristic and professional look while maintaining usability. The contrast between the bold headings and clean body text ensures that the content hierarchy is clear, helping users navigate the site effectively.

## Testing
- **Browser Compatibility**

  The website was tested for functionality and responsiveness on the following browsers:  

  - **Opera GX**  

    ![Opera GX Browser Compatibilty](./readme_pictures/testing/browsers-compatibility/opera-gx-testing.png)
  - **Firefox**  

    ![Firefox Browser Compatibilty](./readme_pictures/testing/browsers-compatibility/mozilla-firefox-testing.png)
  - **Microsoft Edge** 

    ![Microsoft Edge Browser Compatibilty](./readme_pictures/testing/browsers-compatibility/microsoft-edge-testing.png)

  All tests confirmed consistent performance and user experience across these platforms.

- **Responsiveness**: All buttons and links were tested for responsiveness on various screen sizes and devices.
- **Functionality Testing**
  All buttons and accordions on the website were thoroughly tested to ensure they function as intended. Each button performs its respective action correctly, and the accordions expand and collapse smoothly, displaying the appropriate content without any issues.

- **Validation**: The HTML and CSS have been validated using the W3C Validator to ensure compliance.
  - Index Page HTML Validation:

  ![W3C Validation Index page](./readme_pictures/testing/w3c-validation/index.png)
  In this case, no action is required as the use of multiple "h1" elements aligns with the design structure of the page. Each "h1" is contextually relevant, and accessibility tools handle them correctly in this implementation.

  - Index Page HTML Validation:

- **Lighthouse Performance**: The website was evaluated using Google's Lighthouse extension and received the following performance ratings on all pages:

  - Performance: 90/100
  - Accessibility: 98/100
  - Best Practices: 100/100
  - SEO: 100/100

  ### Bugs Encountered

  - **Accordion Arrow Color Issue**:
    While customizing the Bootstrap accordion, I encountered an issue where the arrow color could not be changed using standard CSS. This was due to the use of an embedded SVG in Bootstrap for the arrow icons. 

    - **Solution**:  
    To resolve this, I modified the `fill` attribute of the SVG directly in the CSS to change the arrow color. This successfully applied the desired color to the accordion arrows.

  - ### General Observations
    No additional bugs or significant difficulties were encountered during the development process. The project proceeded smoothly, with all features working as intended.
