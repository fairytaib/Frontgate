The design of the website incorporates the following color scheme to ensure a modern, visually appealing, and user-focused experience:

### Colors Used

1. **Gunmetal (#1F2933)**: Used for the navbar and some background sections to provide a sleek, dark tone that conveys professionalism and modernity.
2. **Charcoal (#2C3E50)**: Utilized in main content sections to create a clear, unobtrusive background that allows text and visuals to stand out.
3. **Payne's Gray (#505B68)**: Employed as an accent background to create variation between sections while maintaining cohesion in the overall design.
